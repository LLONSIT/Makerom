Notes:

This needs to be built in a Motif 1.2 environment or later.

The include file directory and the library name need to be determined.
Both the code and the manual pages will need updating.

The manual Page for GlxDrawingArea should be symlinked to
GlxMDrawingArea when installed.

All glXChooseVisual attributes (except GLX_USE_GL) have been
incorporated into the widget.  If there are any changes or new
attributes, they must be added to the widget.  Unfortunately, there
are several places that need modifying:

GlxDrawA.h:
	Update the comment near the top.
	Add Appropriate GlxN and GlxC declarations.
GlxDrawAP.h:
	Declare variables in the GlxDrawingAreaPart structure.
GlxDrawA.c
	Add them to the resources array.
	Update either the intAttribs or the booleanAttribs array.
Manual
	Update the table in the GlxCreateMDrawingArea.3X manual page.
