The source code examples in this directory accompany the examples
printed in the _OpenGL Programming Guide_, published by Addison-Wesley;
ISBN 0-201-63274-8.

The source code examples here need to be compiled with libaux.a
(which in turn needs files from libtk.a).

To compile these examples, there are two directories:  libtk and libaux,
which contain helper routines to open and manage windows and handle
events (such as keyboard and mouse input).  You'll want to compile the
libtk library, then the libaux library, and then the book examples.

On an X Window System-based machine, you are advised to use a Makefile.  
There are Imakefiles (system independent files used to generate Makefiles)
in each of those directories, to help you create a Makefile, no matter 
what system you are on.   To create such a Makefile, use the imake routine.
For example, on a Silicon Graphics workstation, you might issue the command:

        % imake -I/usr/lib/X11/config -DUseInstalled

Then use the Makefiles generated to compile the libraries:

        % make
