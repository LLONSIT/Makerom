# Makerom
This project aims to decompile the debug and non-debug version of makerom and makedisk (soon)

```diff
- WARNING! -

* The repository right now is a reimplementacion with the matched functions of makerom 

```

# Clarifications

- Why the Irix binary?

Because the irix binary provides a mips assembler and being of this architecture it can be easily disassembled in order to match its functions

- Are there implementations?

Yes and no, on the one hand it could be that there are certain reimplementations in functions that only the IDO compiler can accept, and that therefore are ported to the gcc syntax, that is why there is a `NON_MATCHING` conditional


# Info 

- Makefile only to check the gcc syntax

- There will be support for SGI! 

- Recompilation soon!

- Someone2639 (The magic python script!, final segment.c function)
- Tcmg2 (Final segment.c functions!)

# Special thanks

- Someon2639 (Without that magic script, the project would not have taken a 360Â° turn)

- Fluffy Kouprey (He was at the beginning of the project, he helped with all kinds of functions, without a doubt, without his help, the progress would not have been made.)
